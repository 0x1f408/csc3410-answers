## CSC3410

All projects from `CSC3410 - Data Structures` from the Fall 2014 Semester at [Georgia State University](cs.gsu.edu).

This is intended as a *reference* for students having difficulty; all projects earned a 95 or higher.

I have previously mentored `AP Computer Science A`, `CSC2310 - Principles of Computer Programming`, and `CSC3410 - Data Structures`, 
and provide limited assistance through here or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0x1f408).
